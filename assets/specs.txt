Semantic Tagging and Document Outline - 15%

Students will be provided with a site design file. With this, each
student will use what they have learned regarding basic semantic
tagging and creating a document outline in HTML. Apply this knowledge
and best practices to build out a proper semantic page based off of
the provided design file.


Details

- See the image in the 'assets' folder called 'web_1200.jpg'
- Think about how the different parts of this page might be tagged semantically
- Think about what the heading names might be, and how they might be arranged in a logical hierarchy (document outline)
- Write the HTML for this page in the index.html file
- ONLY HTML is required for this project, no CSS (it is supposed to look very plain in the browser)
- You will be graded on your ability to use semantic tagging and build a document outline properly
- I have included a 'hidden' class in CSS for you
- Use the 'hidden' class to hide any headings that you wish to use for your document outline but that you would not want shown in the browser
- Additional CSS (styling/colors/fonts/layout) is NOT required
- Use proper semantic tagging as taught in class (e.g. nav, section, article, aside, etc.)
- Use divs to group elements in addition to semantic tags
- Construct a proper document outline as taught in class
- Use <img> tags to place the images from the 'images' folder in the correct place in your HTML
- Use <a> tags as required to create links in your HTML
- Helpful resources are available on FOL under content->links->MDN Resources
